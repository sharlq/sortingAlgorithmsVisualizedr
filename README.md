# view the project
you can view the project through the fjollowing link  
https://sorting-algorithms-visualizerr.netlify.app/   
when you test the project for first time using the browser developer tools it might seems that is not responsive but that is not right  
just refresh the page and it will transform this will not cause a problem because if you opened it from mobile it will open directly with size that fit the mobile  
this issue is beacause i had to use JS variables to optimize  the width of data bars and the need to re-render to refresh the variable that controls their width
and this is because you can control the size of the array from the app
